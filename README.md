# Marat Bakasov's personal website

My personal website!

## What

Ideally, a website where a user can login, submit code for execution and see some stats about visitors

## Why

To make a fun website that can collect data over time as this seems like a big enough project to be maintained over time

## How
1. Implement a go+templ+htmx frontend
2. Implement code running for user-submitted Go, Js, Python code
3. Implement stat collection about visitors and code 

## When

Someday, hopefully :)
